  as all part of the same name/email address instead of as a separate email address.

  Content-Disposition header.
* Added a work-around for mailers that quote the disposition value in a Content-Disposition
  header.

Note: If you are not yet ready to port your iOS application to the Unified API,
      you will need to stick with the 1.0.5 release. The Classic MonoTouch API
